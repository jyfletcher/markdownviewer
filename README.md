# Markdown Viewer

---

## About

Markdown Viewer is a simple python script that serves a single markdown file over http so it can be rendered to html and viewed in a browser.

To view changes to the markdown file just refresh the page.

## TODO
- Extend this to serve multiple markdown files and serve corresponding images, etc. to the browser
